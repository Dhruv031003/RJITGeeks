RJIT Geeks, a Codechef Campus Chapter, was founded to foster a coding atmosphere and raise awareness on campus, allowing students to acquire valuable insight into the technical world. It has cooperated with Abhigyan Abhikaushalam Student's Forum (AASF), IIITM Gwalior, to offer seminars, plenary sessions, and other events to support this endeavor, bringing their resources and insight to the campus.
